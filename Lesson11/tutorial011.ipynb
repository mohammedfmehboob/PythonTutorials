    "### Setting up the simulation and the variables needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simulation will use some basic concepts from statistics that you might be familiar with (but it does not really matter if you are not!). HR is measured in Beats Per Minute (BPM). The HR of a population are somehow variable across individuals and generally normally distributed. This means that folks have a higher HR at rest, others a lower one, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following will be the assumptions used for our simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Rest HR\n",
    "The mean rest HR of a population of 25-years old individuals is about `75` BPM. The variance across individuals (the between samples variance) is about `10` BMP. This means that whereas the majority of the individuals will have a HR of about `75` BPM, several will have one as low as `55` BPM and others as high as `95` BPM. We will assume that the Rest HR will be associated with the Sleep and Exercise HR. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Sleep HR\n",
    "We will assume that the mean HR during sleep goes down by about 20 BPM from the population mean of `75` BPM. That means that an average individual will have an HR of `55` BPM during sleep. More generally that reduction corresponds to about `70%` reduction in HR during sleep (`55/75=0.733`). \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Exercise HR\n",
    "We will use a commom computation an assume that max HR during a high-intensity exercise will be predicted as follows: `max HR = 220-Age`, that means that for our 25 years old Austinites the expected HR under high-intensity exercise is 195 BPM. That is about a `2.6` times higher than the base HR in the population. Sowe will use that number, `2.6` to do our calculations."

After that, we can simulate the Sleep HR as a modification of the distribution of Rest HR and similarly the Exercise HR as an increase of the distribution of Rest HR. In both cases, Sleep and Exercise HR will have their own variance added on top of the variance already existing in the group of ten Austinites. "
